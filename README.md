Content Management System (CMS) - Server-Side
Overview
This repository hosts the server-side application of a Content Management System (CMS), designed to manage and deliver dynamic web content. The CMS allows users to easily create, manage, and publish digital content such as text, images, videos, and more, with an emphasis on scalability, security, and flexibility.

The server-side CMS handles the core operations of content storage, retrieval, user authentication, permissions management, and communication with the database and front-end interfaces.

Features
User Authentication & Role Management: Secure user login with roles such as Admin, Editor, and Viewer, each with different access levels and permissions.

Content Creation & Management: Users can create, edit, and manage content dynamically through a web interface. The system supports different content types such as text, images, videos, and file uploads.

Content Categorization: Categorize content into sections, tags, or categories to help organize and filter content effectively.

API Integration: Exposes RESTful APIs to allow external services and front-end applications to access and interact with the CMS data.

Content Versioning: Track and manage content versions, allowing content to be rolled back to previous states when necessary.

Security & Permissions: Role-based access control (RBAC) ensures that content management and configuration settings are secured and only accessible by authorized users.

Scalability: Designed to scale with the growth of your content and traffic, ensuring high performance even as demands increase.

Content Scheduling: Schedule content to be published or unpublished at specific times, allowing automated content management.
